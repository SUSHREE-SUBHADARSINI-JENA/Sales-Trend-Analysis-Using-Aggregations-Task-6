# 🛒 Sales Trend Analysis Using SQL

This project analyzes sales trends by calculating **monthly revenue** and **order volume** from an e-commerce dataset using SQL aggregations.

## 📂 Dataset

The analysis uses a sample table named `online_sales` with the following fields:

- `order_id` (INT) – Unique identifier for each order
- `order_date` (DATE) – Date when the order was placed
- `amount` (DECIMAL) – Revenue generated by the order
- `product_id` (INT) – Identifier for the purchased product

## 🛠 Tools

- SQL (PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQLite)
- Optional: Any SQL IDE or CLI like DBeaver, pgAdmin, MySQL Workbench, DB Browser for SQLite

## 🧱 Table Creation

```sql
CREATE TABLE online_sales (
    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    order_date DATE NOT NULL,
    amount DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
    product_id INT NOT NULL
);
````

## 🧪 Sample Data

```sql
INSERT INTO online_sales (order_id, order_date, amount, product_id) VALUES
(1, '2023-01-15', 120.50, 101),
(2, '2023-01-20', 230.00, 102),
(3, '2023-02-05', 340.75, 103),
(4, '2023-02-10', 180.00, 101),
(5, '2023-03-01', 210.60, 104);
```

## 📊 Analysis Query

```sql
SELECT 
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_date) AS year,
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM order_date) AS month,
    SUM(amount) AS total_revenue,
    COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS order_volume
FROM 
    online_sales
GROUP BY 
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_date), EXTRACT(MONTH FROM order_date)
ORDER BY 
    year, month;
```

> 🔁 For MySQL or SQLite, modify `EXTRACT()` accordingly (`YEAR(order_date)`, `strftime('%Y', order_date)`, etc.)

## 📈 Output

| year | month | total\_revenue | order\_volume |
| ---- | ----- | -------------- | ------------- |
| 2023 | 1     | 350.50         | 2             |
| 2023 | 2     | 520.75         | 2             |
| 2023 | 3     | 210.60         | 1             |
